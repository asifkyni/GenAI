Welcome to our repository dedicated to GenAI! Here, we explore cutting-edge AI technologies like Large Language Models (LLM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). LLMs like GPT-3 excel in understanding, generating, and manipulating text data, while CLIP extends this capability to images, enabling tasks like image recognition and captioning. With their human-like proficiency, these models unlock a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Dive in to discover how GenAI is revolutionizing AI research and applications.
